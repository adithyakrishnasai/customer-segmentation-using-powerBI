# customer-segmentation-using-powerBI
Purpose: To group customers based on shared characteristics, improving marketing and sales strategies.
Required Datasets
1)Customer Dataset - CustomerID, Email, Phone, City, State, Country, Gender, Age, TotalSpent, LoyaltyPoints, PreferredPaymentMethod, etc.
2)Transaction Dataset - TransactionID, CustomerID, ProductID, TransactionDate, Quantity, TotalAmount, PaymentMethod, etc.
3)Product Dataset (optional)-ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price, StockStatus, etc.

### Step-by-Step Process for Customer Segmentation in Power BI

**Step 1: Data Preparation**  
Begin by importing the necessary datasets into Power BI using the Get Data feature. Clean the Customer Dataset by removing invalid email domains, standardizing phone numbers, and addressing any missing values through logical imputation. Create derived columns for customer classifications based on spending and loyalty, and ensure consistent date formats and country codes.

For the Transaction Dataset, eliminate duplicates and handle missing data for key metrics like Quantity and Total Amount, while standardizing payment methods. Clean the Product Dataset by removing duplicates and imputing missing values in Price and Stock Status. If applicable, clean the Region Dataset by removing invalid entries and standardizing country codes. Establish relationships between datasets, linking CustomerID in the Customer Dataset with corresponding IDs in the Transaction Dataset for accurate analysis.

**Step 2: Build Customer Segments**  
With cleaned data, use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to group customers based on behaviors, such as RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. Visualize the segments using bar charts for age groups, scatter plots for RFM segments, and pie charts for payment method distribution, supplemented by slicers for filtering data.

**Step 3: Advanced Segmentation Techniques**  
Utilize Power BI's clustering feature to automatically group customers based on shared characteristics, enhancing segmentation. Perform detailed RFM analysis to classify customers into segments like Platinum, Gold, and Dormant based on purchasing behavior.

**Step 4: Example Customer Segments**  
Identify various customer profiles: Platinum Customers are high spenders with recent activity; Gold Customers are moderate spenders; Dormant Customers have low spending and infrequent purchases. Additionally, categorize payment-based segments such as Credit Card Users and PayPal Users for targeted marketing insights.

This structured approach to customer segmentation in Power BI allows businesses to leverage data effectively for personalized marketing and improved customer experiences.

Conclusion
Successful customer segmentation in Power BI enables tailored marketing strategies and enhances customer experience. By ensuring datasets are cleaned and standardized, you facilitate meaningful analysis and actionable insights.
